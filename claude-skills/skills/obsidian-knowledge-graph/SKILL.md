# Obsidian Knowledge Graph

Synthesizes existing knowledge sources into a live, interlinked Obsidian vault at `obsidian-vault/`.

**Sources consumed (read-only):**
- `.claude/skills/figma-batch-builder/knowledge-graph.md` — wired pages, Figma frames, nav structure, component patterns
- `.claude/skills/` — all installed skills (one vault note per skill)
- `src/ui/index.js` — shared component library exports
- `src/retailer/components/*.jsx` — retailer page component sources (imports, screen types)
- `src/advertiser/components/*.jsx` — advertiser page component sources
- `graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md` — community/hub context
- `obsidian-vault/Figma/design-system-map.md` — all 41 Figma DS pages with nodeIds and PNG status
- `obsidian-vault/Assets/Components/` — 42 component PNGs (atoms, molecules, organisms, tokens)

**Output:** `obsidian-vault/` — Obsidian-compatible Markdown with YAML frontmatter and `[[wikilinks]]`.

## Phase 0.5 — Figma Design System Sync Check (optional)

Before rebuilding components from source, check whether Figma Design System assets are current:

1. Read `obsidian-vault/Figma/design-system-map.md` — check PNG status column for "Remaining without PNGs"
2. Read `obsidian-vault/index.md` — check `PNGs downloaded` count in Quick Stats
3. If PNGs are stale or missing: use `get_screenshot` + `curl` to download missing PNGs before writing component notes
4. For Figma variable tokens: use `use_figma` with `figma.variables.getLocalVariableCollections()` to pull current token values — write to `Components/tokens/` notes

This phase is **optional** for a code-only sync (no Figma MCP) but **required** for a full design-system sync.

## Phase 0 — Pre-flight

Read the vault schema before writing a single note:
```
.claude/skills/obsidian-knowledge-graph/vault-schema.md
```

Then check the last full rebuild:
```
obsidian-vault/_meta/last-sync.md   (may not exist yet — that's fine)
```

Then load source data in parallel:
1. `.claude/skills/figma-batch-builder/knowledge-graph.md` — full file
2. `src/ui/index.js` — component exports
3. `graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md` — community/hub context

> If `knowledge-graph.md` cannot be read, stop and tell the user — the vault rebuild requires it.

---

## Phase 1 — Component Inventory

**Goal:** Build a list of every reusable component + which pages use it.

1. Parse `src/ui/index.js` exports → categorize as `atom` or `molecule` or `pattern`
2. For each export, read its source file (e.g. `src/ui/atoms/Button.jsx`) to extract:
   - Named export name
   - Props (from destructured params or JSDoc `@param`)
   - Brief description from first JSDoc comment if present
3. Scan `src/retailer/components/*.jsx` import statements to build a **reverse map**: component → list of retailer pages that import it
4. Scan `src/advertiser/components/*.jsx` import statements to build the same reverse map for advertiser pages

**Note:** Page source files are at `src/retailer/components/` and `src/advertiser/components/`. There is no `src/components/` directory — do not use that path.

Result: a structured list ready to become `Components/atoms/*.md` and `Components/molecules/*.md` notes.

---

## Phase 2 — Page Inventory

**Goal:** One note per wired page, fully cross-linked.

1. Parse **§1 Wired Pages Registry** table from `knowledge-graph.md`
2. For each row (nav-id, component file, section, group, screen type):
   - Read `src/components/{ComponentFile}` — extract top-level import statements that match UI components
   - This gives the "Components Used" wikilinks for the page note
3. Also list **unwired pages** (in LeftNav, no App.jsx case) from §1 with a `status: unwired` frontmatter tag

Result: data for `Pages/index.md` + one `Pages/{ComponentName}.md` per page.

---

## Phase 3 — Skills Inventory

**Goal:** One note per skill in `.claude/skills/`, cross-linked to the components and pages they operate on.

1. List all subdirectories in `.claude/skills/` — each is a skill
2. For each skill, read its `SKILL.md` frontmatter and first section to extract:
   - `name` — from YAML frontmatter
   - `description` — from YAML frontmatter (truncate to 2 sentences for the note)
   - **Category** — classify as one of: `design-pipeline`, `code-quality`, `ux-research`, `knowledge`
   - **Requires Figma MCP?** — yes if SKILL.md mentions `use_figma`, `figma MCP`, or `figma-batch-builder`
   - **Auto-fixes?** — yes if SKILL.md describes applying edits or auto-replacing
   - **Key arguments** — list `--flag` patterns found in SKILL.md
3. Note which components each skill operates on (e.g. `component-reuse-enforcer` → links to all `src/ui/` components; `token-enforcer` → links to Tokens/audit)

**Skill categories:**

| Category | Skills |
|---|---|
| `design-pipeline` | screen-interpreter, figma-wireframer, figma-batch-builder, react-implementer, design-orchestrator, ux-ideator |
| `code-quality` | token-enforcer, lineicon-enforcer, component-reuse-enforcer, shadcn-to-osmos |
| `ux-research` | ux-auditor, design-critic |
| `knowledge` | obsidian-knowledge-graph |

Result: data for `Skills/index.md` + one `Skills/{skill-name}.md` per skill.

---

## Phase 4 — Figma Frame Inventory

**Goal:** One note per known Figma frame.

1. Parse **§7 Figma Frame ID → Screen Mapping** from `knowledge-graph.md`
2. For each frame (node ID, screen name, component file):
   - Compute the linked page note path: `[[Pages/{ComponentFile without .jsx}]]`
3. Note: Figma frame notes are informational only — do not call any Figma MCP tool during vault rebuild

Result: `Figma/frames/{FrameId}.md` for each mapped frame.

---

## Phase 4 — Nav Structure

**Goal:** A single navigable map of the left-nav tree.

Parse **§3 LeftNav Section → Group Structure** from `knowledge-graph.md` and produce `Navigation/structure.md` with:
- One H2 per top-level section (Control Center, Analytics, Finance, etc.)
- One H3 per group within a section
- Bullet list of `[[Pages/{NavId}]]` wikilinks under each group

---

## Phase 5 — Token Audit Snapshot

**Goal:** Surface hardcoded design value violations in the vault.

Run a lightweight grep (no LLM needed):
```bash
grep -rn --include="*.jsx" --include="*.css" -E "(#[0-9a-fA-F]{3,8}|rgb\(|rgba\(|px [0-9])" src/ | grep -v "node_modules" | head -80
```

Write the top violations to `Tokens/audit.md` using the token-audit note template.
If `Tokens/audit.md` already exists and `last-updated` is today, skip and reuse it.

---

## Phase 6 — Write All Vault Notes

Write notes in this order (parent directories before children):

1. `obsidian-vault/index.md` — master entry point
2. `obsidian-vault/_meta/last-sync.md` — ISO timestamp
3. `obsidian-vault/_meta/sync-log.md` — create if missing, append if exists
4. `obsidian-vault/Components/index.md` — component table
5. `obsidian-vault/Components/atoms/{Name}.md` — one per atom (14 total)
6. `obsidian-vault/Components/molecules/{Name}.md` — one per molecule (26 total)
7. `obsidian-vault/Components/organisms/{Name}.md` — one per organism (NavShell, TopBar, DataCharts, AdCreatives, Offsite, PackageAdmin, Funnels)
8. `obsidian-vault/Components/tokens/{Name}.md` — one per token tier (Colors, Typography, GridLayout, Spacing, CornerRadius, Shadows)
9. `obsidian-vault/Pages/index.md` — full wired-pages registry table
8. `obsidian-vault/Pages/{ComponentName}.md` — one per page
9. `obsidian-vault/Navigation/structure.md` — nav tree
10. `obsidian-vault/Figma/index.md` — frame list
11. `obsidian-vault/Figma/frames/{FrameId}.md` — one per frame
12. `obsidian-vault/Tokens/audit.md` — token violations
13. `obsidian-vault/Skills/index.md` — skills registry table (all 14 skills)
14. `obsidian-vault/Skills/{skill-name}.md` — one per skill in `.claude/skills/`

**Wikilink rules:**
- Component → Pages: `[[Pages/ComponentName]]`
- Page → Components: `[[Components/atoms/Button]]` or `[[Components/molecules/StatCard]]`
- Page → Figma frame: `[[Figma/frames/13-92792]]`
- Figma frame → Page: `[[Pages/PersonaConfigPage]]`
- Nav structure → Pages: `[[Pages/ComponentName]]`
- Skill → Components it enforces: `[[Components/atoms/Button]]`
- Skill → Skill it chains to: `[[Skills/react-implementer]]`

**Never** fabricate imports or usages you did not confirm by reading source files. If unsure, omit the link and leave a `<!-- TODO: verify -->` comment.

---

## Phase 7 — Summary Report

After all notes are written, output a summary to the user:

```
✅ Obsidian vault rebuilt at obsidian-vault/

Components:   {N} atoms, {M} molecules, {P} patterns
Pages:        {W} wired, {U} unwired
Skills:       {S} documented
Figma frames: {F} mapped
Token issues: {T} violations found

Open obsidian-vault/ in Obsidian Desktop to explore.
Incremental updates active — vault syncs automatically on every src/ file save.
```

---

## Quality Rules

1. **Never invent a component usage** — only link pages to components you confirmed via import statements in the source file
2. **Frontmatter is required** — every note must have the YAML block from vault-schema.md; Obsidian Dataview won't index it otherwise
3. **Wikilinks use relative vault paths** — `[[Components/atoms/Button]]` not `[[Button]]` (avoids ambiguity)
4. **One entity per file** — do not combine two components or two pages into a single note
5. **Preserve existing wikilinks** — when updating a note that already exists, never remove wikilinks that are present in the current file unless the source confirms the relationship no longer exists
6. **Pages with no component file** — unwired pages get a note with `status: unwired`; do not fabricate a file path
7. **Figma frames are historical** — only record frames from §7 of knowledge-graph.md; never add frames by guessing
8. **Tokens/audit.md is ephemeral** — it reflects the state at rebuild time; add a `last-updated` frontmatter field so the user knows when to trust it
